Reference: Jenkins official documentation
any:
Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on any available agent. For example: agent any

none:
When applied at the top-level of the pipeline block no global agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline run and each stage section will need to contain its own agent section. For example: agent none

label:
Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on an agent available in the Jenkins environment with the provided label. For example: agent { label 'my-defined-label' }

Label conditions can also be used: For example: agent { label 'my-label1 && my-label2' } or agent { label 'my-label1 || my-label2' }

node:
agent { node { label 'labelName' } } behaves the same as agent { label 'labelName' }, but node allows for additional options (such as customWorkspace).

docker:
Execute the Pipeline, or stage, with the given container which will be dynamically provisioned on a node pre-configured to accept Docker-based Pipelines
